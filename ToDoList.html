        We need to complete the following:
            <!--Make button for attacking enemy-->
            Make it so that when a unit is dead, it disappears
            Fix cash by:
                Add two cash systems
                Make it so that subtracting cash doesn't return NaN
            Add a movement function, like moving left and right
        
        <!--When completed, comment stuff out.-->
